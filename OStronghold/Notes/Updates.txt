Stronghold - Simcity/Arena-like RPG game
========================================
[doing]
(00022)
- Need to think of another way of applying to jobs (what to do if there are two vacant jobs.
- Stronghold -> think of charging money for rent - auto calculate according to cost + returns.

[to do]
- Game -> Add load/save (Serializable)
- Game -> Move constants in code to xml files
- Character -> Add location for Character (Area class) -> walking action
- Character -> Add attributes (i.e: Strength, Intelligence, etc.)
- Character -> Add level (how level up affect stats)
- Stronghold -> Add list for all population (includes commoners AND stronghold leader for example) - since SHleader doesn't get hungry now.
- Stronghold -> Start populating characters in Stronghold and create daily life routines.
- Stronghold -> Add Arena for battles
- Stronghold -> Setup economy with buildings and shops
- Stronghold -> Need to think about multiple job applicants (job experience?)
- StrongholdLeader -> Autocontrol economy
- CharacterMindSet -> Enhance character mindset thinking into effects.
- InventoryItem -> Add Categories for Items
- Classes - Add classes (i.e: Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief)
- BattleEngine - Add battle engine for fights (have to generic: i.e: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, etc.)
- Job - Added minimum requirements for applying to job (need Attributes)

[future thoughts]
- Add guilds (sort of a mini Stronghold according to class)
- Add raw materials for building construction
- Put weight into factor.
- Add areas - good for multithreading update (thread update per area for area population).
- Change hp,mp,stamina to decimals for regen to work better
- constants will change according to mindset or personality
- Foods has satiety rate
