Stronghold - Simcity/Arena-like RPG game
========================================
[doing]
(00017+)
- Stronghold -> Add jobs (simulate job and simulate population trying to apply to job, add job experience?) - need to figure out how to do this.
             -> Updated in gametime about jobs (need to determine how person chooses what job to apply for - currently first job in list)
			 -> Need to change gametime working hours for person
- Stronghold -> Add shops/buildings (planning + construction phase + hiring people, etc.)
- Stronghold -> Setup economy with buildings and shops
- StrongholdLeader -> Autocontrol economy

[to do]
- Character -> Add location for Character (Area class) -> walking action
- Character -> Add attributes (i.e: Strength, Intelligence, etc.)
- Character -> Add level (how level up affect stats)
- Stronghold -> Add list for all population (includes commoners AND stronghold leader for example) - since SHleader doesn't get hungry now.
- Stronghold -> Start populating characters in Stronghold and create daily life routines.
- Stronghold -> Add Arena for battles
- CharacterMindSet -> Enhance character mindset thinking into effects.
- InventoryItem -> Add Categories for Items
- Classes - Add classes (i.e: Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief)
- BattleEngine - Add battle engine for fights (have to generic: i.e: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, etc.)
- Job - Added minimum requirements for applying to job (need Attributes)

[future thoughts]
- Add guilds (sort of a mini Stronghold according to class)
- Add raw materials for building construction
- Put weight into factor.
- Add areas - good for multithreading update (thread update per area for area population).
- Change hp,mp,stamina to decimals for regen to work better
- constants will change according to mindset or personality
- Foods has satiety rate
